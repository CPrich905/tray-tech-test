## Brief:
- Command line, terminal or web app
- run on mac OS X, Linux(x86-64) or modern web browser
- written in Node.js/JavaScript
- Can make use of open source libraries that don't directly address the problem statement

### Deliverables:
- public link to the source code (including code that is not part of the normal program run such as scripts)
- clear instructions on how to obtain/run the program

## To run
install dependencies with
```yarn```
run the tests:
```yarn test```


## Approach
- as a key element of the assessment criteria was testing, I began by considering the most suitable testing suite to use. I have tried using Mocha before, but wanted to try something new. Jest was suggested by a colleague and a simple sum test was relatively straightforwards.


## PLAN/NOTES
MVP
- tests! Try Jest? Mocha for bigger platforms (see sum test on https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html)
* input needs to be parsed
- X build docReader for input.txt & model for hoover. TEST
- build movement fns for hoover. TEST
- build dirtCheck fns for hoover. TEST
- write outputs for hoover. TEST
- check above works in terminal

+VP
- browser interface
